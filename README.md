# Swedish Number Plates

```p
This is my own learning project for JAVA.
```

It creates an json-file (or txt if you want that) that holds all possible Swedish number plats lika AAA000, A-Z 0-9.

```p
There is 17.576.000 possibilitys from this, and i want to see how far i can take this and speed it up more and more after learning new stuff in Java !
```

Now the first time im running it it takes 12 minutes and 7 seconds on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz 2.11 GHz , fast ssd and 16 gb DDR4-ram.

Current time: 12 minutes and 7 seconds
